# PointRetentionMaximum

Some game mechanics have a point system where a percentage of current points are carried over to the next round. This program is intended to calculate the maximum number of points that can be attained given a base value and retention rate.

Program will get the retention rate and base level from user.
Program will loop through process of retaining and adding points until the old value is equal to the new value (this is the maximum).
For each step, the program will calculate the total number of points lost by not using all points each turn.
